# âš½ FIFA Card Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio website inspired by FIFA card opening packs! This project showcases my skills and experience in a fun, engaging format that football fans will instantly recognize.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Find Here

This portfolio transforms the traditional resume into an interactive FIFA-style player card experience. Just like opening a pack in FIFA, visitors can discover my professional "stats" and information through an immersive interface.

### Key Features:

- **Player Card Display**: A FIFA-style card showing my professional "stats" and profile
- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through different sections (Profile, Season, Stats, Team, League, Country) using the info buttons
- **Stadium Atmosphere**: Immersive background that creates the feeling of being in a football stadium
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices - from mobile phones to large desktop screens
- **Smooth Animations**: Engaging interactions that make the experience feel dynamic and polished

## ðŸš€ What Makes This Special

Instead of a traditional portfolio, this website gamifies the experience of learning about my background. Each section reveals different aspects of my professional journey, making it memorable and engaging for visitors.

Whether you're a hiring manager, potential client, or just curious about my work, this portfolio offers a unique way to explore my skills and experience in an interactive format that stands out from the crowd.
